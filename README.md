## <a name="introduction"/>Introduction - Enterprise Backend as a Service

EBQuery allows you to easily access databases through a REST API.

All you have to do is enter your database connection settings and EBQuery will generate REST API endpoints for all
your database tables and views. Moreover, you can easily add custom SQL queries for access via REST API calls.

EBQuery provides SQL result sets as JSON, XML, HTML or CSV data.

EBQuery is an Enterprise Backend as a Service along lines of [Parse](https://parse.com/) but for your own databases.
It's like [Heroku Dataclips](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/dataclips) but for non-cloud, on-premises databases.

EBQuery is a JavaEE application that's securely hosted on your servers. No data ever leaves your company!
